# Rock-fragment-analysis
Developed a Python program to analyze rock fragments in 2D images.
Utilized OpenCV and Scikit-image libraries to process the images and extract relevant information.
Implemented various image filters and edge detection techniques to identify boundaries of rock fragments.
Created a distribution chart based on the sizes of the blast rocks in a large area, enabling better visualization of the data.
Conducted statistical analysis on the dataset to derive meaningful insights.
Presented the findings to a team of geologists and successfully integrated the results into geological research.
