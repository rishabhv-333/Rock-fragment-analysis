# Rock-fragment-analysis
* Developed a Python program to analyze rock fragments in 2D images.  <br>
* Utilized OpenCV and Scikit-image libraries to process the images and extract relevant information. <br>
* Implemented various image filters and edge detection techniques to identify boundaries of rock fragments. <br>
* Created a distribution chart based on the sizes of the blast rocks in a large area, enabling better visualization of the data. <br>
* Conducted statistical analysis on the dataset to derive meaningful insights. <br>
* Presented the findings to a team of geologists and successfully integrated the results into geological research. <br>
